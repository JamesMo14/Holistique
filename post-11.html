        <p class="article-subtitle">My only regret is that I didn't do it sooner!</p>
        <p class="article-meta">By Yvonne &middot; Jul 2, 2025 &middot; 12 Min Read</p>

        <div class="article-body">
            <p>I met my husband in Bali on a warm, balmy night when neither of us were particularly interested in meeting anyone at that particular moment. I mean, we were both seeking true love and a lasting relationship. We just didn't plan on it happening while on holiday separately.</p>

            <p>It's true what they say &mdash; it always happens when you least expect it. But I do believe that I manifested him into my life because our relationship is one of the most intentional things I've ever done.</p>

            <p>Ever since we got together, I've made it a personal goal to figure out exactly how it all came to be. Hours upon hours have been spent going over every minute detail of my life leading up to that fateful night and the following few weeks which sealed the deal for us.</p>

            <p>You see, we didn't actually date at all. I moved right in with him and we were married within just six months. That was nearly six years ago, and although we've been through our fair share of trials and tribulations; I daresay we are one of the happiest couples we know.</p>

            <p>So here's a run down of what led me to manifesting my perfect partner:</p>

            <div class="separator">&middot; &middot; &middot;</div>

            <h2>Step One: Get Crystal Clear</h2>

            <p class="drop-cap">I got really clear about what I wanted and I wasn't afraid to tell anyone who cared to listen, especially guys that were appearing in my life.</p>

            <p>For far too long, I had been the &ldquo;cool&rdquo; girl who was just down to have a good time. I'd let so many guys slip away, never letting them know how much I actually wanted to be loved and cherished as a girlfriend.</p>

            <p>Maybe a part of me never felt that strong of a connection with any of those guys, but still; I know that if I had been more honest about my desires then a loving fulfilling relationship and marriage would've become my reality so much sooner.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>Telling a guy that you want to settle down and get married is a scary thing to do. Most girls refrain from mentioning the &ldquo;M&rdquo; word in fear of being rejected. They're thinking, &ldquo;But what if he doesn't even have a chance to get to know me?&rdquo;</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>But the thing is, you're not saying &ldquo;Hey! It's you that I want. I've only just met you but I know I want to get married to you!&rdquo;</p>

            <p>You're simply saying, &ldquo;I'm in a place in my life now where I'm very clear about what I want and that's marriage. If you're also looking for the same thing then we can explore further and see where it takes us. Otherwise, please don't waste my time.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>Men will respect that.</p>

            <p>Close to the time when I met my husband, there was another guy that I went on a date with whom I didn't even give my marriage talk to, but he sensed it from the energy I was giving off.</p>

            <p>He said to me that night, &ldquo;I can tell you're looking for a serious relationship and I'm not that person for you.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>This guy indirectly led me to my husband because he introduced me to another guy who turned out to be my husband's best friend! He was the one that insisted we all meet up in Bali.</p>

            <p>So my point is, whatever you are looking for. Be honest about it and don't settle for anything less. That doesn't mean you can't still have fun. Those guys who told me they didn't want a serious thing with me, I still hooked up with them because &mdash; let's face it; when you're single you don't exactly know when the next romp is coming along, so you take what you can get.</p>

            <p>Settling would be continuing to see someone for an extended period of time, even being in a relationship with them when you know that they don't want the same thing. You're just hoping and praying that you can somehow change their mind with time and amazing blowjobs &mdash; I tried, it doesn't work.</p>

            <p>I actually learned a lot from my ex-boyfriend about manifesting a dream partner. When we accidentally got together; as in, we were fuck buddies who unintentionally started dating&hellip; he finally admitted that I wasn't even close to what he had been wanting in a relationship that would lead to marriage.</p>

            <p>His pure and raw honesty meant that I couldn't hate him for it.</p>

            <p>Plus, I really did love him and when you love someone you let them go so that they can find happiness with someone else.</p>

            <p>And boy did he find it.</p>

            <p>Everything happened so fast that I'm sure there was some overlap. I don't even think he was like, &ldquo;Hey you're not the one for me cuz there are all these qualities that I want that you don't have&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

            <p>I think it was more like, &ldquo;Yup! I'm totally ready to jump ship now cuz I've actually found my dream woman while dating you so thanks and bye!&rdquo;</p>

            <p>But let's not get into the nitty gritty aspects of how that unfolded. The point is that he was honest about his desires and <strong>the Universe responded by giving him exactly what he wanted</strong> in the form of his dream partner.</p>

            <p>From seeing what happened for him, I recognised the power of that kind of honesty and clarity.</p>

            <div class="separator">&middot; &middot; &middot;</div>

            <h2>Step Two: Raise Your Vibrations</h2>

            <p><strong>Raise your vibrations and keep them high.</strong> This is as simple as doing all the things you love, hanging with friends, going to see a performance, or cooking some exciting new dish. Literally, whatever you love the most that makes your heart flutter with joy &mdash; do more of that.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>When you can be grateful for everything that you have in your life as a single person, in a weird counter-intuitive way, that's when you quickly become an un-single person.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>Basically, being truly happy with your current situation will elevate you to where you actually want to be.</p>

            <p>And you don't even have to be high on life for an extended period of time. When it happened for me, it was like a switch had been flipped.</p>

            <p>One second I suddenly had the realisation that my life was complete and almost the next my future husband appeared in my life.</p>

            <p>Although, one more thing did happen that morning (read on in Step Three) and I know it wasn't just a happy accident as there are no coincidences in life. Everything leads to something, and this occurrence definitely helped me to close one chapter and open the page to a whole new one.</p>

            <div class="separator">&middot; &middot; &middot;</div>

            <h2>Step Three: Bless What Came Before</h2>

            <p class="drop-cap">Not only was I able to fully let go of my ex boyfriend, but I even went as far as to bless his new relationship. What happened was that we had been best friends from the beginning. Don't ask me why because I can't explain it either, but we just got along really well.</p>

            <p>So even after we broke up we still wanted to be a significant part of each other's lives. Which meant that eventually I had to get over this very uncomfortable thing, which was to meet his new girlfriend.</p>

            <p>I still remember that motorcycle ride over to their hotel in Bali. My stomach was in knots! But I knew that being his friend meant I had to at least meet her face to face. It was one of the most uncomfortable things I ever had to do in my life, or so I thought.</p>

            <p>From the moment I set eyes on her, I knew that all of the stress and anxiety I'd felt was just a figment of my imagination. Not to say that it wasn't real, but I had created all of it in my own head. There was never any need to feel afraid or nervous.</p>

            <p>This woman was the sweetest, most beautiful, angel sitting before me. From the minute we spoke, I knew that all I felt for them was pure love. I couldn't even help it.</p>

            <p>The love I felt was actually overwhelming. It made me feel so comforted to know that my ex was in such good hands.</p>

            <p>Meeting my ex's new girlfriend gave me the closure that I didn't even know I needed.</p>

            <p>When I left them, I texted them both, &ldquo;I have overwhelming love for you and I'm so happy you found each other.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>It was the truth.</p>

            <p>What happens with the Universe is that you get exactly what you wish for others. So it's no surprise that on that very evening after wishing love for my ex and his new girlfriend, I met my husband to be.</p>

            <div class="separator">&middot; &middot; &middot;</div>

            <h2>Step Four: Surrender and Let Go</h2>

            <p class="drop-cap">Surrender and let go of the outcome. One of the most difficult things for people to understand about manifestation is the idea that wanting something is the same feeling as not having it. While, not wanting something is the same feeling as already having it. So if you want to get what you want, then you have to not want it.</p>

            <p>So confusing, isn't it?</p>

            <p>I guess the easiest way to explain this is to know what you want, make a wish list and just put it out there. Set those intentions.</p>

            <p>How do you want to feel with this person? What does your life look like with them? What are their personality traits? How do their finances and outlook on money compare with yours? Do they want to build a family? Buy a house?</p>

            <p>Whatever it is you want in a partner, get it all very clear in your mind. It doesn't matter so much if you write it down or not. These traits can also change along the way as you might meet someone or remember something from your past and think, I'll add that to the order!</p>

            <p>Of course, it's always fun to have something written down so after you've manifested the person you can look back and see what's come true!</p>

            <p>Some people say you have to look at the list every day and pray over it, but I don't think that's the way to do it.</p>

            <p>The more you want something, the more you're actually putting energy into the feeling of not having it.</p>

            <p>What you need to do is get yourself into the feeling of already having it and that's how you will actually attract what you want because everything is energy and like attracts like.</p>

            <p>The simplest way I can explain how you can accomplish this is to put that piece of paper or list away and tuck it into some place in your mind. Just don't think about it anymore and go on living your life to the fullest every day.</p>

            <p>You can talk about your dream guy and his attributes, but speak as if he's already yours. Speak with a calm sense of confidence because the only thing that is in your way is time &mdash; and time doesn't really exist.</p>

            <p>When I was on the path of manifesting my husband, everyone around me knew about the kind of guy I wanted. I didn't even have to say anything, it was so obvious in the way I drooled over men with six pack abs. To the point where one photographer I was working with even tried to give me dating advice!</p>

            <p>He said, &ldquo;You know, if I can give you one piece of advice it's this &mdash; don't date someone with a six pack because he's going to be spending so much time at the gym that he won't have time for you at all. Someone who spends all their time in the gym only cares about himself. He loves himself too much to love you.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>This was a test from the Universe.</p>

            <p>Was I going to settle for something less than what I wanted? Would I let someone else's opinion dictate my life and my choices?</p>

            <p>Nope!</p>

            <p>I still stuck to my guns, meaning I continued finding muscles sexy and attractive.</p>

            <p>In my mind, someone who spent all that time in the gym actually loved taking care of themselves and it's the ultimate sign of self love. Only someone who loves themselves can love others.</p>

            <p>I say all this about six pack abs, but when I met my husband he didn't have the best body. He actually had more of a dad bod. He was a heavy drinker and what's worse, he'd binge on sweets from M&amp;S the day after a night of partying so that meant putting on extra weight.</p>

            <p>However, within weeks of being with me; a non-drinker, he significantly cut down his alcohol intake and his junk food intake too!</p>

            <p>We actually went on a health rampage and ate strictly salads loaded with sous vide chicken breast for almost a year.</p>

            <p>We were both in the best shape ever.</p>

            <p>I think it was around 2&ndash;3 months after we met that I noticed his body was totally sculpted and his abs were rock hard. The six pack abs had always been there, they were just hidden under a layer of crisps and gummy worms!</p>

            <div class="separator">&middot; &middot; &middot;</div>

            <h2>Step Five: Pick Your Non-Negotiables</h2>

            <p class="drop-cap">Why would I settle for someone without a six pack? Well, that's what brings me to this next step. After what seemed like an eternity of not finding my dream partner, I was seriously getting desperate. Everything in my life seemed so perfect and I was just plain lonely.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>&ldquo;O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?&rdquo; &mdash; William Shakespeare's <em>Romeo and Juliet</em></p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>So you know that list of all the attributes that you may or may not have written down?</p>

            <p>My older and wiser friend gave me some advice in the time just leading up to me actually meeting my husband, he said, &ldquo;Pick 3 things on your list that are your strict non-negotiables. The top 3 things that you just can't live without.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>Funny enough, six pack abs were not even on that list at all. My top three had zero to do with looks or finance or anything superficial.</p>

            <blockquote class="pull-quote">
                All I really wanted was someone to love and accept me, and be proud of me.
            </blockquote>

            <p>I was a sex party host at the time and that's akin to being a stripper or a prostitute in some people's perspective. It was quite difficult to be taken seriously and I do recognise now that I probably made things more tricky with all my half naked photos on Instagram too.</p>

            <p>What kind of guy would want to date or marry someone who had an address book full of guys who she'd hooked up with?</p>

            <p>My ex-boyfriend freaked out one day when he came home to find me lounging around in my lacy bra and panty set. He thought that I'd just slept with someone &mdash; not even sure it would've been considered cheating since we were active in the sex party scene, but that's not the point.</p>

            <p>That was the day that I knew I had to be with someone who was so confident and secure in himself that he'd never ever come up with the false assumption that I'd slept with someone else just because I refused to turn on the air conditioning and instead preferred to wear less clothes.</p>

            <p>I've never enjoyed air conditioning. It always feels like it dried my nose and throat out to the point where I'd feel pain in my throat. In all the years that I lived in Asia, I actually preferred to wake up covered in sweat than to have the air conditioning turned on.</p>

            <p>Needless to say, my husband is one very confident man. He's almost borderline cocky when it comes to what he has to offer and he knows I'd be a total idiot if I ever cheated on him or left him.</p>

            <p>He's still the best thing that's ever happened to me and it's so easy for me to say that &mdash; the words roll off my tongue because I say it to him almost every day!</p>

            <div class="separator">&middot; &middot; &middot;</div>

            <p>It's my wish for everyone to find their dream partner and to manifest all the things that they want in their lives. I hope this article helps anyone who is struggling on their manifestation journey!</p>
