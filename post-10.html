        <h1 class="article-title">How Acupuncture Saved Me Three Times</h1>
        <p class="article-subtitle">And eventually changed my life</p>
        <p class="article-meta">By Yvonne &middot; Aug 20, 2025 &middot; 7 Min Read</p>

        <div class="article-body">
            <p>I never imagined I'd become an acupuncturist.</p>

            <p>Back when I first started learning acupuncture, I was at the peak of running a thriving business &mdash; hosting luxury sex parties and boudoir photo shoots.</p>

            <p>I was flying between all the major cities of the world, juggling wild nights and creative chaos. Even though I've walked away from all of that now, I'm still grateful for those times. Without the lifestyle and income from those parties, I would've never been able to afford the acupuncture lessons.</p>

            <p>I was already living in the fast lane. I wasn't looking for a new career path. I just wanted to have a life skill in my back pocket for later on in life.</p>

            <p>Somehow I imagined myself as an old lady in my fifties or sixties doing acupuncture for people. I never thought I'd start doing acupuncture professionally in my thirties.</p>

            <p>Acupuncture isn't something that you just decide to do on a whim. It's a huge commitment; not just financially to take classes but also the time that you commit to studying means you can't work.</p>

            <p>I think it's safe to say that most acupuncturists had a miraculous healing from it that prompted them to get into acupuncture. For me, acupuncture fixed me three times. The last one was probably the most dramatic.</p>

            <p>It's hard not to go down the acupuncture rabbit hole when you've experienced first hand how it works.</p>

            <h2>The First Time: A Chalazion That Wouldn't Budge</h2>

            <p>It started with a stubborn chalazion that had lingered for three months. If you don't know what that is, imagine a stye or eye pimple that just won't budge. Normally, it should go away with warm compress. Mine remained a hard lump.</p>

            <p>I was somewhat lucky that you could only see it when I blinked my eyes since it was right in the center of my upper eyelid. Some people get them at the lash line meaning it's much more visible and usually bulging red.</p>

            <p>Western eye doctors would cut the chalazion and squeeze it out like a pimple. Sometimes that procedure could leave a dent in your eye lid, but worst of all it has an over 90% reoccurrence rate. My friend and brother had the same issue and after it was gauged out, it came back straight away.</p>

            <p>I've always been scared of any kind of surgical procedures so that was out of the question.</p>

            <p>Then I went to visit an old friend in Australia. He was actually my ex boyfriend from university days. He'd taught himself how to do acupuncture using an app and some books. I trusted him because of our romantic history, but also because he's always been careful in everything he did.</p>

            <p>He's also a rock climber, used to hanging off the edge of high cliffs. He's good with his hands and detailed rope work.</p>

            <p>We went to a Chinese medicine shop where he bought some needles and moxibustion. I still remember how he checked in with me every step of the way. He didn't inflict any pain with the needles or burning the moxa.</p>

            <p>That night, I went to bed as per usual and the very next morning, the chalazion drained out completely.</p>

            <p>I woke up with my left eye completely stuck together with all the crust that had drained out from the chalazion. It was disgusting but also such a huge relief. I couldn't believe that my eye was completely back to normal.</p>

            <p>It felt like magic. But I didn't think too much of it yet.</p>

            <h2>The Second Time: Food Poisoning on Christmas Eve</h2>

            <p>Seventeen months later, acupuncture came to my rescue again.</p>

            <p>It was Christmas and my friends and I were invited to a fancy molecular gastronomy dinner. The first course was a soup that arrived in a canister. It was squirted into our bowls, so you can imagine how thin the soup was.</p>

            <p>Just pure liquid, and I still couldn't drink it. When I took a sip, it felt like acid hitting my stomach.</p>

            <p>A friend was visiting from university, who had just started her acupuncture diploma program. You're going to think all my friends became acupuncturists at this point, but it was just this one and my ex.</p>

            <p>She said, &ldquo;Oh, I forgot I have some needles that I stole from school. I should do some acupuncture for you tonight.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>As we had been best friends since university days, I trusted her wholeheartedly. This was a friend that I'd shared vibrators with believe it or not. That's how close we were.</p>

            <p>That night, she put some needles in my stomach and it started to gurgle. Around that time, I also had a terrible cough. I had to sit up and have a drink of water during the acupuncture session. I could feel a whoosh of energy, or qi moving through my entire body. It was unlike anything I'd ever felt.</p>

            <p>The very next day was my birthday. We went to my favourite restaurant, and I was able to have normal food like nothing had happened.</p>

            <p>That's when I started paying attention.</p>

            <h2>The Third Time: Healing From Trauma and Alopecia</h2>

            <p>The third time was the most miraculous &mdash; and the most emotional.</p>

            <p>After leaving an abusive eighteen month relationship where I'd been physically assaulted, I was carrying more trauma than I realised.</p>

            <p>Just a few months after the break up, a close friend moved in to live with me. I stepped out of the shower, hair wet and parted. She gasped and asked what had happened to my head. I looked &mdash; and there it was. A large bald spot. Several, actually.</p>

            <p>Nobody had told me. I didn't even know how long I'd been walking around like that.</p>

            <p>I knew then: I needed acupuncture again. There was no other treatment for me. Based on the last two times that acupuncture helped my body heal naturally, I just knew I had to get acupuncture again.</p>

            <p>The acupuncturist asked me all the right questions. He was fully confident that my hair would grow back. After just one treatment, my hair started growing back.</p>

            <p>I remember it very clearly because that weekend I went on a roadtrip to a nearby town called Kanchanaburi. I had the habit of getting my hair washed and dried in salons quite often because it felt nice to have someone wash my hair and it always looked better coming out of a salon.</p>

            <p>The salon that I went to had positioned two mirrors so that I could see the back of my head. The bald spot was as big as a US quarter and it was staring at me. I felt disgusted and saddened by it.</p>

            <p>However, I had also made peace with my hair not growing back. I was writing articles for an online magazine during that time and I'd just done an interview with a very inspiring woman who had also gotten alopecia years ago. She ended up losing all her hair including eyebrows and nose hairs!</p>

            <p>But she was so radiant and confident and just beautiful in every sense. She was married and wanted to start a family with her husband. She also had a great career.</p>

            <p>It felt like the Universe was showing me that going bald was not the end of the world. If that was my destiny then I'd be okay too.</p>

            <p>When I went back for my second acupuncture treatment, my acupuncturist showed me on a small mirror that my hair was growing back. The entire bald spot was covered with a soft grey carpet of baby hair!</p>

            <p>Over the next 6 months it grew like a patch of grass, sticking up as my hair is straight and thick. I had to use my longer hair to try and cover it and keep it flat.</p>

            <p>Seeing my hair grow back miraculously with acupuncture showed me that acupuncture was something I wanted to have in my life. If I got regular treatments I probably would not have gotten to that place where my hair fell out from stress!</p>

            <h2>Learning Acupuncture &mdash; While Hosting Sex Parties</h2>

            <p>I enrolled in a Traditional Chinese Medicine course while still running my events business. Honestly, I wouldn't have been able to afford the program without it &mdash; acupuncture school isn't cheap, and I was flying between Singapore and Bangkok for classes.</p>

            <p>We treated real patients, including cancer patients. We needled each other constantly &mdash; sometimes even in intimate places like CVGV points. That might sound strange, but it was part of learning to trust, to hold space, to see healing not as clinical but as human.</p>

            <p>Some of my classmates became close friends &mdash; people who would later be part of my deeper healing journey, but that's another story.</p>

            <h2>When the Meaning Ran Out</h2>

            <p>After the pandemic, we moved to London. I went back to what I knew &mdash; modeling. Art nude and lingerie work. Later, I transitioned into photography events and commercial gigs. But no matter how glossy it looked, it all felt hollow.</p>

            <p>I just couldn't find meaning in any of it.</p>

            <p>I was going through some of the darkest mental times I've ever faced. The work paid the bills, but my soul felt empty.</p>

            <p>Eventually, I came to the conclusion that I needed to do acupuncture. I found an acupuncture certification program in London that worked for me. I got insured to practice &mdash; and for the first time in a long time, I felt aligned. Like I was finally doing something that mattered.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>I didn't become an acupuncturist for money or prestige. I became one because it healed me when nothing else could &mdash; over and over again.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>It made me believe in the body's ability to recover.</p>

            <p>It reminded me that trauma doesn't have to define us.</p>

            <p>That energy moves. That pain shifts. That healing is possible &mdash; even when you think it isn't.</p>

            <p>I used to host parties that gave people escape. Now, I hold space for people to come back to themselves.</p>

            <p>And that, for me, is the real miracle.</p>
